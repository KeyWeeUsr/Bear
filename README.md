A bear as a spirit animal is strong and confident, it's a guide to take
leadership in your life without fear, provides courage and a stable foundation
to face challenges. The bear spirit helps to dedicate time and energy to
introspective practices.

Same as the bear spirit, this application provides you with confidence to take
leadership in your digital life, find all the mess you've been collecting for
a while and gives you a stable foundation to face the challenge of removing
duplicated data on your machine.

Once you start removing duplicates, soon you realize how much free space you've
gained and looking through the various files from the high-level point of view
will slightly poke you to set the order to the files, to categorize them and
eventually make your machine a clean space.

## Installation

Currently there is a Python module installation available, and some
platform-specific releases. Check the assets in the GitHub [releases](
https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/Bear/releases).

### Binaries

The Windows build is made specifically for Windows 10, so it might not work
without Universal CRT present on the system. The GNU/Linux build is created
on Debian trusty and anything older than that most likely won't work. Use
Python installation instead.

The "extension" `.linux` and `.macos` is just a workaround for GitHub assets
since it does not allow the same name for multiple assets.

Feel free to rename it to `bear` and put it somewhere on your `echo $PATH`
(`echo %PATH%` for Windows) or call it in-place. Don't forget to make it
executable first if on GNU/Linux or MacOS with `chmod +x bear`.

### Python package

#### Requirements

* Python 3.7+ (3.6 should work too)

You can install a stable version with:

    pip install https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/Bear/zipball/stable
    pip install thebear

For the cutting-edge available changes use `master` branch:

    pip install https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/Bear/zipball/master

## Usage

There is a list of basic use-cases:

* remove all duplicates and keep the newest (modified date) files:

      bear --duplicates folder1 folder2 ... --keep-newest

* remove all duplicates and keep the oldest (modified date) files:

      bear --duplicates folder1 folder2 ... --keep-oldest

* find all duplicate files within specific folders

      bear --duplicates folder1 folder2 ...

* hash all files in specific folders

      bear --hash folder1 folder2 ...

* traverse folders for files

      bear --traverse folder1 folder2 ...

* hash specific files:

      bear --files file1 file2 ...

There are other, advanced options you can list with `bear --help` to speed up
the lookup, to control the output and more.
